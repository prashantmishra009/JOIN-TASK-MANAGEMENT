                            built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the
                            <span class="join-blue">Developer Akademie</span>.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <h2>How to use it</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="join-blue">Join:</span></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                                <p>When you log in to <span class="join-blue">Join</span>, you'll find a default board.
                                    This board represents your
                                    project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback”
                                    and "Done".
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Creating Cards</h3>
                                <p>In <span class="join-blue">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
                                    projects. Go to the "Contacts"
                                    section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added,
                                    these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the
                                    board.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                                <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
                                    individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new
                                    card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date,
                                    assignees, etc.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                                <p>Moving Cards
                                    As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by
                                    dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.</p>
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                                <p>Deleting Cards
                                    Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                                    Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution
                                    when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
                                    <br>
